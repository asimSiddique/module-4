        Love is a teacher, but one must know how to acquire it, for it is acquired with difficulty, 
        it is dearly bought, one must spend a great deal of labour and time on it, 
        for we must love not only for moment and fortuitously, but for ever.

        If you fell outward to the limit of the universe, would you find a board fence and signs reading DEAD END? No. You might find something hard and rounded, as the chick must see the egg from the inside. 
        And if you should peck through the shell (or find a door), what great and torrential light might shine through your opening at the end of space? 
        Might you look through and discover our entire universe is but part of one atom on a blade of grass? Might you be forced to think that by burning a twig you incinerate an eternity of eternities? 
        That existence rises not to one infinite but to an infinity of them?
