        Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, 
        that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. 
        If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years.
        If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge.
        If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. 
        If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.
        Hiro used to feel this way, too, but then he ran into Raven. 
        In a way, this was liberating. He no longer has to worry about being the baddest motherfucker in the world. 
        The position is taken.
